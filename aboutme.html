                <h6> Have you ever felt that you were doing something you didn't like for living, just because it was the "right" decision? </h6>
                
                <p> <span class="that-was-me"> That was me ðŸ™‹! </span> But I founded the perfect spot where <span class="highlight photo-one">  solving problems using design, technology and psychology, business focused, </span> and make a way of living.</span>
                <p>Moving from clinical psychology was a difficult decision, but eventhough I enjoyed my time <span class="highlight photo-five"> applying pshychology and supporting people</span> ... I was not fulfilled.
                  At that moment I've got an opportunity in digital marketing, where I found here a whole new world and started learning a litte more of the <span class="highlight photo-six">digital world, coding and designing some canvas </span>; also living abroad in the UK, improving my skills.</p>
                <p> Then <span class="highlight photo-seven"> I discovered UX,</span> a field where I could use my background, solve problems, been creative and work on the tech world.
                So I went all the way in, I definetly got into what I wanted to do.</p>

                 <h6> Getting more personal. </h6>
            <p> Some of my pleasure comes from working as a team looking and deeply involved in a project, like when <span class="  highlight photo-two">I used to play semi-professional football. </span></p>
            <p>Everytime I go trekking, I love to <span class="highlight photo-three">get lost or try alternative  paths </span>, I like to think that few people discover what I do. </p>
            <p>Because of my background, and <span class="highlight photo-four"> where I was  raised</span>, I'm a freak of history, antropology and culture.</p>
            <p>I consider my self <span class="highlight photo-eight">positive and flexible </span>, I enjoy the challenges in life as when you are starting in a new place.  </p>
